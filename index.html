                <p>My name is Lucy Schaefer. I have a beautiful golden brown coat and a pinkish tinge nose. I am a viszla-mix. I used to weigh 42lbs but I have gained weight. I love human food although my human-parents say ‘no, no, sorry Lucy’, or they would wash all the flavors out of their food leftover before giving it to me. It isn't tasty but beats eating kiddle all day long. People always hide chocolates away from me. What’s the big deal with chocolate?</p>
                
                <p>I am turning three years old soon. I hope my parent will bake me the dog meatloaf again like last year! Lately she has been very busy. She disappears for many hours in the day. She would hurry us during the morning walk. I have not even sniff anything interesting. Happy and I watch sadly as she drives off every morning at 9am. Sigh! A dog’s life is not easy.</p>
                
                <p>I have lived with my human family since they adopted me from the shelter in October 2016. When I first came to live with them, I chewed up a lot of things that I grabbed from the table. Don’t blame me. I did not know the table was a no-go zone. Happy tried to warn me. One time, I chewed up something very important. Leo was upset when he found the thing I’d destroyed. They looked high and low for the oval transparent thingamajiggy. I did not know it will end up this way. My nose told me that thing had a great strong scent of my human-kid. I miss him so much when he leaves the house every morning with a big backpack. It contains a big lunch bag. I wish I can eat it all. So back to that thing, well, they were upset. All of them were not happy with me. I was still new in their home. I was forgiven because I did not know the rules. I learned. Human-parents talked a lot about getting a new pair but I heard the words ‘glasses’, ‘cost a lot’, ‘insurance’… over and over again. Why is it always about money? Human being needs to learn too. Money does not rule the world. Love does. I love my family so much even Happy. He tries to hump me when he needs to let go of steam but hey, I do not let him get away with it.

                <p>If you meet me, don’t try to pet me. The first year of my life was spent in a horrible place. I was taken to a stinky place with a lot of other dogs from all walks of life. I am so happy to be with my family now and they with me.</p>
